#Sorting things

As a blacksmith we're sometimes given the challenge of dealing with all the useless gemstones we find while sorting ore bins.

What if we need to sort these gemstones by hardness in order to add them to a piece of armor. 

Each gem is a javascript object that looks like this

```
var gem = {
  name: 'ruby',
  hardness: 9.0
}
```

Your job as a smith is to create a function `sortBy` that takes two parameters:

* the first is an array of gems.
* the second can be either a function, or a property name.


Your function needs to go through the array of bins, pass them into the callback function, and based on what that callback function returns, place it in the array.

Heres a quick example:

```
var gems = [
  {
    name: 'ruby',
    hardness: 9.0
  }, 
  {
    name: 'diamond',
    hardness: 10.0
  },
  {
    name: 'jade',
    hardness: 7.0
  }
];
pluck(sortBy(gems, 'hardness'), 'name') // ['jade', 'ruby', 'diamond']
```

It should also work when you pass a function rather than a property name

```
var arr = [1, 2, 3];
sortBy(arr, function(n) {
  return Math.sin(n);
}); //  returns [3, 1, 2]

```
