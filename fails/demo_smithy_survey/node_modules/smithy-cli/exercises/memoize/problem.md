# As a blacksmith we need to keep track of our blueprints and know what items we have already created a blueprint for. We do not want to create duplicate blueprints of the same item. The memoize function can help us with this issue. Let's say we have a helmet function: 

```
var helmet = function(){
	console.log('blueprint of helmet is finished');
}

```

If the helmet function gets run already, we don't want to run it again because that would mean we have created the blueprint of the helmet twice. So, if we pass this helmet function as the input of the memoize function:


```
memoize(helmet)(); // run helmet only once
memoize(helmet)(); // do not run helmet because it ran already

```

The memoize function ensures that a function runs only once. When passed to the memoize function, will not run again if it already ran. Otherwise, it will run but won't run ever again even if called through the memoize function.
