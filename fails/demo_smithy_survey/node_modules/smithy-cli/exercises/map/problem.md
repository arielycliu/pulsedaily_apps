#Cleaning your materials

A lot of your time as a smith will be cleaning out garbage materials and only returning the stuff that you need. We built our pluck function earlier to do this but it had a key error, it would only return an array of a single key. Imagine we are giving a bunch of bins like this

```
bin1 = {
  iron: 10,
  copper: 5,
}
bin2 =  {
 iron: 4,
 copper: 4,
 granite: 5
}
```

If we were to call our pluck function with `'iron'` we would only get the iron and we would throw all the copper away.

What if we could loop through this array of bins, run a function on every single one and add the output to a newly created array? We need to call this function `map`.

We create a function `takegoldAndSilver` that returns  a new object with only the gold and silver in the bin. 
```

function goldAndSilver(bin) {
  var gold = bin.gold;
  var silver = bin.silver;
  return { gold: gold, silver: silver};
}


```

Then we pass this function, into our new function `map`. 

When you pass a function into another function, it us called a `callback` function. Remember this, its something that we're going to use over and over again.

We will pass two things to our `map` function, an array of bins, and a function that we want called on every one.

```
map(arrayofBins, goldAndSilver) //
```
This function should take the original array, run the function on each element and return the newly created array
```
[
 { gold: 5, silver: 3},
 { gold: 2, silver: 3}
]
```
