#Combining armor

After a battle you are given a ton of excess armor that you need to go through to discover what can be salvedged and what cant. We have to go through each package, grab only the object we need and put it in another array

each array is made up of a `helmet` object, a `chest` piece and a `sword`, 

```
  var package1 = [
    {
      type: 'helmet',
      style: 'japanese',
      quality: 'High'
    },
    {
      type: 'chest',
      style: 'viking',
      quality: 'poor'
    },
    {
      type: 'sword',
      style: 'japanese',
      quality: 'high'
    }
  ];

  var package2 = [
    {
      type: 'helmet',
      style: 'english',
      quality: 'medium'
    },
    {
      type: 'chest',
      style: 'viking',
      quality: 'poor'
    },
    {
      type: 'sword',
      style: 'german',
      quality: 'high'
    }
  ];

```
After a battle you're given an array of a ton of these packages and you have to write a `zip` function that seperates all the helmets into a certain bin, all the swords etc etc.

```
zip([package1, package2])
/* This returns 3 arrays, one of all the helmets, one of all the chestpieces, and one of all the swords */

```

heres another example, we are zipping up an array of competing smiths

```
zip(['fred', 'barney'], [30, 40], [true, false]); 
// returns  [['fred', 30, true], ['barney', 40, false]]
```
