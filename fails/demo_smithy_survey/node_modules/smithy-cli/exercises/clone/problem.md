# As a blacksmith we need to know how to replicate a tool we have already built. In this case we have a box full of nails, drills, and hammers:

```
var box = [
	{ nails: 5 },
	{ drills: 2 },
	{ hammers: 1 }
	];

```

The numbers resemble the amounts of each tool available in the box. We are now going to clone the tools to make the exact number of copies of each item.

```
var clonedBox = clone(box) // returns a copy of the box;

clonedBox[0] === box[0]  //this should return be true

```
