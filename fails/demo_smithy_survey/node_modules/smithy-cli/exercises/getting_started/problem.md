Let's do a little housekeeping first, remember you can always type `smithy` in your terminal to come back to the menu. 

You're going to want to move to directory where you can play around and write a new file. We recommend that you have one file that you use to run all your exercises.

Why don't you make a new directory to hold all the code we're going to be writing. In there we need to make a new file ( you can call it anything you want, it just needs to have a `.js` ending. )

We recommend that you start at the Forge Exercise and work your way through them step by step.  

Remember to read the instructions carefully and understand what the problem is asking you to do.

If you ever get lost, remember, you can always run javascript files from the terminal by running `node` and then the filename

To pass this lesson just run `smithy verify` and then the name of your file
