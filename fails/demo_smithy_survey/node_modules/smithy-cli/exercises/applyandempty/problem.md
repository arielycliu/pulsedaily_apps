# Processing Materials

This exercise is all about passing the output of one function into the input of another function, over, and over again. This is a core concept in javascript

Imagine that we have a a piece of iron and we need to refine it and convert it to steel, lets define an object to represent this material

```
var product =  {
  material: 'iron',
  carbon: false,
  temperature: 20
};
```

imagine we have a whole bunch of functions
```
function heatUp(product) {
  product.temperature += 500
  return product;
}
```

Then we define another function that adds carbon!

```

function addCarbon(product) {
  product.carbon = true;
  return product;
}
```
Then lastly, we define a function, `isSteel` that converts our iron to steel if it is at 1500 degrees and has carbon

```
function isSteel(product) {
 if(product.carbon && product.temperature >= 1500) {
    product.material = 'steel';
 } 
 return product;
}
```

Your job is to define a function `applyAndEmpty` that takes two inputs, an inital object and array of functions.
It should pass this input into one function, and then pass the output of the function to the next and on and on

```
var processToSteel = [
  heatUp,
  heatUp,
  heatUp,
  addCarbon,
  isSteel
];
var product =  {
  material: 'iron',
  carbon: false,
  temperature: 20
};
applyAndEmpty(product, processToSteel);
/* this returns 
var product =  {
  material: 'steel',
  carbon: tru,
  temperature: 1500
};
*/

```
