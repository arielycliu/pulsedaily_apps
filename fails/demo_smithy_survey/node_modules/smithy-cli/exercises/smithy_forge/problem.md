# For This challenge we're going to be covering some javascript fundamentals.
You all are probably familiar with javascript in the browser, but this may be your first time playing with javascript in the console.


##Creating Variables

Before we can really get started on making things we have to learn how to create variables, these are the building blocks we're going to use to create everything later on.

Its pretty easy in Javascript there are 2 parts to any variable creation, you declare the variable, and then you say what it is equal too. We're going to create a variable `iron` and set it equal to the string `"iron"`

```
var iron = "iron"

```

In your code, create two variables `copper` and `zinc` equal to the strings `"copper"` and `"zinc"`.

##Smelting metals

Now that we have our variables created we are going to create functions, you can think of functions as a smelter that can take variables and output(return) something different. You create functions and then call them later down the line.

```
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

I want you to create a function `smelter` that takes two inputs. When you call that function with `copper` and `zinc` it should return `"bronze"`


## Blacksmith lvl 2

The great thing about functions is that you can use them again and again. If you give them different inputs, sometimes called parameters, they can return different outputs. If we take our smelter function and pass it two new variables `carbon` and `iron` equal to `"carbon"` and `"iron"` your function should return steel. Do this without breaking the bronze functionality you did earlier!

Remember, a good smelter should accept materials in any order...
