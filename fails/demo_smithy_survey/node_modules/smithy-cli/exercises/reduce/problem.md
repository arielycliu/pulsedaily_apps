#Smelting materials

Sometimes a blacksmith has a ton of useless iron ingots lying around near the furnace and they need to combine them into one large ingot to make it eaasier to handle. 

We need to write a function `reduce` that takes an array of ingots like this:

```
  var ingot1 = {
    weight: 12
  };
  var ingot2 = {
    weight: 5
  };
```

Our functions job is to take this array of ingots and smelt it down into one giant ingot. To do this, we need to sum up the weights of all the different elements in the array.

we need to create a function `reduce` that takes an array, a callback function, and an initial value.

We need to pass that callback function 4 parameters
1. the `previous value` aka whatever the last callback function returned
2. the `current value` aka the element that we are currently on
3. the `index` of the current element
4. the `array` as a whole

Heres a example of using reduce to multiply all the elements of an array together
```
var arr = [3,6,9];

function reducerFunction(prevValue, currentValue, index, array) {
  return prevValue + currentValue;
}
reduce(arr, reducerFunction, 1);
```
this callback will be called 3 times, with `prevValue` increasing every time
