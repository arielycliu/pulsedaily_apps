# As a blacksmith we need to be able to filter out specific ores from a bunch of different ones based on instructions. In this case we have a bin of six different ores:

```
var bin_of_ores = ['iron', 'coal', 'bronze', 'copper', 'granite', 'cobalt'];

```

We have a function that has the instructions of which ores need to be filtered out - element refers to each ore, index refer to the position of that ore in the collection, and collection refers to the entire bin of ores.

When we call our filter function we want to filter out every ore in the bin based on a set of instructions:

```
var instruction = function(element, index, collection){
	return element % 2 === 0;
};

filter(bin_of_ores, instruction(element, index, collection)); 
// returns ['coal', 'copper', 'cobalt']

```
