Iterates over elements of an array invoking callback for each element. The callback should be passed the element, the current index, and the entire array.
```
var callback = function(element, index, array) {
 console.log(element +"," +index +"," +array);
}
forEach(['a','b','c'], callback); // prints a,0,[1,2,3] b,1,[1,2,3] c,2,[1,2,3]
```

For each element in the array, the callback we passed is called. The callback can be customized, but in the above example, the callback prints out the element, index, and entire array.
