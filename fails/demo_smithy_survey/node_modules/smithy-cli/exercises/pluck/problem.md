# As a blacksmith we need to make sure we have quality materials
In this case we're going to be given a bunch of of different bins of various ores. They will be objects that look like this:

```
var bin = {
  iron: 20,
  granite: 5,
  diamond: 1
}
```
We probably don't want to use all these materials, usually we just want one thing.
Our job is to write a `pluck` function that can return an array of all the different values.

```
var bins = [
  { iron: 20, granite: 5 }, 
  { iron: 10, copper: 3}
  ];

pluck(bins, 'iron');
// this should return
[ 20, 10]

```
