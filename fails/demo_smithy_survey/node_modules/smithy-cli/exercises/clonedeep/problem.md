# Before we built a clone function that made a copy of an array of tools, however it had a slight error, it wouldnt work if your tools were made of other tools. For example, a blacksmith's bellows is made of two objects, a valve and two handles, our box would now look like this

In javascript objects are passed by reference, what this means is that if you just copy an object it only copys the memory location of that object. In our case, we actually want to copy the **values** not just the objects themselves

```
var box = [
	{ nails: 5 },
	{ drills: 1 },
  { bellows: {
      nozzle: 1,
      handles: 2
    }
  }
];
```

Your function `cloneDeep` should clone the values, not just make a copy of the objects!
```
var deepClone = cloneDeep(box)
deepClone === box // false
deepClone[0] === box[0] // false 
deepClone[0].nails === box[0].nails // true
```
